# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game
A fun Python game built using the turtle graphics library - inspired by the classic Frogger! Help the turtle cross a busy road while dodging speeding cars.
Each time you reach the finish line, the level increase, and so does the speed!

# 🎮 Overview
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Python’s built-in turtle module. It includes custom classes for the player, car manager, and scoreboard, each handling a specific part of the game logic. Your goal is simple - move the turtle 🐢 to the top of the screen without getting hit by a car 🚗.

# 🚀 How to Run
  1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
  2. Clone or download the project files.
  3. Run the main file:
    python main.py
  4. Use the Up arrow key to move your turtle and avoid the cars!

# 🧱 Key Concepts Covered
  - Object-Oriented Design (separate classes for player, cars, and scoreboard)
  - Inheritance and class interaction
  - Event listeners and keyboard bindings
  - Randomly generated cars for dynamic gameplay
  - Increasing difficulty as you level up
  - Collision detection and “Game Over” message
